    <h1>screenshare series / quaroutine </h1>
    <br>
    <p>the result of quarantine, for me, has been an ability to do something every day (quaroutine...?)- which I have never in the past felt able to. i am making a drawing of my screen each day that i am at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the spirit of sharing, I hope that anyone who views this project will send me (a curated or candid) screenshot of their laptop or computer screen. In return, I will include (a part of) your screenshot in one of my future drawings. Return to see if you can find which drawing your screen is featured in!</p>
