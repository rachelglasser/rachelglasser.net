              <p class="typo">The focus of this project was to learn about using hierarchy to communicate information. The final deliverable was an 11x17 poster. In the class that I created this for, my professor discouraged my original ideas and I went in a completely new direction in which I felt a little disloyal to my own style and ideals. Because of this, I ended up making two final posters. The first one, below on the left, was my deliverable for the class. After the project was finished I wasnâ€™t completely satisfied with this, so I decided to revisit my initial ideas and create a final version of this assignment for myself, seen below on the right.</p>
