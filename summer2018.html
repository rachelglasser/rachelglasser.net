               <p>This summer, I am trying to focus my art practice on the idea of construction and rebuilding, in both an aesthetic and personal sense.</p><br><br><br>
               <img class="normal" src="images/summer1.jpg">
               <p>At the beginning of the summer, as I found myself riding the train to and from NYC multiple times a week, I began to be obsessed with the images that i saw out of the window: huge piles of dirt, long twisted pipes, massive vehicles, and intricate-looking machines. </p><br><br><br>
               <img class="normal" src="images/summer2.jpg">
               <p>Ultimately, the goal of these tools and processes is to create stability in our citiesâ€™ infrastructure, and coincidentally, my own personal goal for the summer is to rebuild myself and stabilize my mental well-being after a difficult end to the school year. 
                With this project, I am somehow trying to combine my obsession with the imagery of the never-ending construction that fills American cities, with the idea of my own process of regaining strength and a sense of stability in my life. </p><br><br><br>
